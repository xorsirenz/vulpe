# `Vulpe` 
Discord bot C2 framework written in python
### `INSTALLATION`
VulpeBot uses [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to allow control from a discord server
```python
cd vulpe
pip install -r requirements.txt
python vulpe.py
```
#
### `FEATURES`
```python
[+] -list       # gets list of connected clients
[+] -connect    # connects directly to client for interaction
[+] -cmd        # send any shell command
# more features are currently being worked on
```
##### When connecting to a client for the first time, VulpeBot will create a unique discord category based on the clients HWID and related channels for the user to interact with the connected bot directly. It then will retrieve a set of base data from the connected client and send the data in a specific discord channel
